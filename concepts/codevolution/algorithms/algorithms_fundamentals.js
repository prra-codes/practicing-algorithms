// What is an Algorithm?

// An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

// As a developer, you're going to come across problems that you need to solve

// Learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficient solve those problems

// One problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms

// Every algorithm comes with its own tradeoffs when it comes to performance

// We evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of its input size

// Time complexity - Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size

// Space complexity - Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size

// Big-O notation describes the complexity of an algorithm using algebraic terms
